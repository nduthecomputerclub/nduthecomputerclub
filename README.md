<h3 align='center'>Welcome to the official TCC Github Account! ðŸ‘¾</h3>

## Who are we?
We are a group of motivated NDU students looking to expand our cohorts' knowledge and experience in the realm of technology, whether it be in the fields of computer science and engineering, information technology, computer graphics and animations, etc... As a club, it is our mission to spread resources as well as awareness to students through various means: talks, workshops, hackathons, daily challenges, and more!
