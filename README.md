# NDU - The Computer Club

### Welcome to the official TCC Github Account! ğŸ‘¾

## Who are we?
We are a group of motivated NDU students looking to expand our cohorts' knowledge and experience in the realm of technology, whether it be in the fields of computer science and engineering, information technology, computer graphics and animations, etc... As a club, it is our mission to spread resources as well as awareness to students through various means: talks, workshops, hackathons, daily challenges, and more!

Here you can find a collection of open source projects we are working on. We are open to issues being opened and discussions getting started under our repositories, however we ask of you to please check the requirements for contributing if you'd like to edit our projects
